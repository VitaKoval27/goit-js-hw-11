# JavaScript Asynchrony — Promises & Timers (HW-11) ⏳

A project dedicated to mastering asynchronous JavaScript, specifically working with the event loop, timers, and the Promise API.

---

### 📝 Project Overview
This module focuses on controlling time and execution flow in the browser. It includes practical tasks such as creating a countdown timer and a color switcher, which require a deep understanding of how JavaScript handles asynchronous tasks without blocking the main thread.

### 🔑 Key Implementations & My Work:
- **Timer Logic:** Built a countdown timer that calculates days, hours, minutes, and seconds using the `Date` object and `setInterval`.
- **Promise API:** Created and handled promises using `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` to manage success and error scenarios.
- **Interval Management:** Implemented logic to start and stop processes safely, preventing multiple intervals from running simultaneously.
- **UI State Control:** Developed buttons that change state (active/disabled) based on whether a timer or process is currently active.
- **Dynamic Styling:** Applied inline styles or CSS classes dynamically to reflect the current state of the application.

### 🚀 Learning Outcomes
* Deep dive into **SetTimeout** and **SetInterval** for scheduling tasks.
* Understanding the **Event Loop** and why non-blocking code is crucial for UX.
* Formatting time strings (padding numbers with leading zeros).
* Handling asynchronous operations with the **Promise constructor**.
